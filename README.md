# Isaac Fitzer's Solitaire game
-Based on the old Windows version

Used in project: 
    -HTML5
    -CSS
    -JavaScript
    -card library from previous lesson

Win by stacking all cards in the 4 complete piles.

In the future I hope to solve the issue with the end sequence being so laggy, and also being able to clear already set setTimeouts to start a new game without bouncing cards
